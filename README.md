# Dragon-Mix
A little game where you can mix potions based on your inputs and then sell them.

I split most of my code into header files (this helps me maintain the code and change it when needed).

Just a small project written in C to check my skills.

### Since it's a small project i won't be uploading any releases. So you have you compile it _yourself_
### And run in the terminal of your OS
